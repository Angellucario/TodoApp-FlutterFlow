# TodoApp-FlutterFlow

## Overview

TodoApp-FlutterFlow is a mobile task-tracking application built using **FlutterFlow** with **Firebase** as the backend. The app is designed to help users organize their daily tasks in a simple and efficient way.

## What the App Does

The application allows users to manage their tasks all in one place. Users can:

* Add new tasks
* Edit tasks if details change
* View all tasks in a list format
* Update tasks as they work through them

All task information is stored in Firebase, so changes happen instantly and stay saved even after closing the app.

## Technology Used

* **FlutterFlow** – used to design and build the mobile app interface and logic
* **Firebase** – used for storing task data and handling real-time updates

## App Functionality

When a user adds a task, it is saved to Firebase and displayed in the app immediately. If a task is edited, the updated information is automatically synced and shown without needing to refresh the app. This setup helps keep tasks organized and up to date at all times.

## Why This Project

This project was created to practice building a complete mobile application using FlutterFlow and connecting it to a backend service. It focuses on real-time data storage, user interaction, and basic task management features.

## Future Improvements

* User authentication
* Task deadlines and reminders
* Task categories or labels
* Improved UI and animations
